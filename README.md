# Spam Message Classifier

A Machine Learning web app that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
Built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, and deployed on **Render**.

### Features
- Classifies SMS or email text in real-time  
- Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Naive Bayes model  
- Clean and simple user interface  
- Deployed live: [Spam Classifier App](https://spam-classifier-1-fy8k.onrender.com)

###  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- NLP (TF-IDF Vectorizer)  
- Render (Deployment)

### How it Works
1. Preprocesses text (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.)  
2. Converts text into TF-IDF features  
3. Predicts using a trained Naive Bayes classifier
